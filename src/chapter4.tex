\chapter{Robustness of fingerprinting techniques against attacks}\label{sec:Robustness}

\section{Experimental setup}
\subsection{Robustness measures}
Fingerprinting schemes should be robust against different attempts to prevent the correct detection of the fingerprint.
Modifying, deleting and adding the values to the fingerprinted data, that can be both benign updates and malicious attacks, can modify or erase the fingerprint. 
A robust fingerprinting scheme should make it hard for the attacker to erase the fingerprint, to modify it in the way that an innocent buyer is implicated as a traitor, or to modify unmarked data such that a valid fingerprint is detected.

In further sections we analyse robustness fingerprinting schemes against different attacks using robustness measures proposed in \cite{li2005fingerprinting}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Misdiagnosis false hit} $(fh^D)$: The probability of detecting a valid fingerprint from data that has not been fingerprinted.
  \item \textbf{Misattribution false hit} $(fh^A)$: The probability of detection an incorrect but valid fingerprint from fingerprinted data.
  \item \textbf{False negative} $(fn)$: The probability of detecting no valid fingerprint from fingerprinted data.
  \item \textbf{False miss} $(fm)$: The probability of failing to detect an embedded fingerprint correctly. False miss rate is the sum of the false negative and misattribution false hit rates, i.e. $fm=fh^A+ fn$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Datasets}\label{datasets}
We use three different datasets for the experiments on fingerprint robustness and quality effects on fingerprinted datasets in the following sections obtained from the UCI Machine Learning repository \cite{Dua:2019}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Forest Covertype dataset\footnote{\url{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype}}
    \item German Credit Data\footnote{\url{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)}}
    \item Adult dataset (train data)\footnote{\url{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult}}
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Forest Cover Type}
The dataset contains measurements related to the forest cover originally obtained from US Geological Survey (USGS) and US Forest Service (USFS) data.
This dataset is chosen due to its desired properties of containing multiple integer-valued attributes, because of its size and because its intended purpose is the classification problem with target \textit{Cover\_Type}. 
This dataset is often used for experiments in watermarking and fingerprinting literature \cite{agrawal2003watermarking,li2005fingerprinting}, therefore using this dataset gives the possibility of comparing our results with previous work.
The dataset has 581,012 rows, each with 54 attributes and no primary key. 
For fingerprint insertion, an extra attribute - \textit{id} is added to serve as the primary key, since the chosen fingerprinting techniques require the presence of the primary key for fingerprint embedding. 
44 out of a total of 54 attributes of the dataset contain binary values. 
We use the remaining 10 integer-valued attributes for embedding fingerprints.
Binary attributes are a result of one-hot encoding, therefore changing one value from 0 to 1 or vice versa would require changing another attribute's value to retain the structure. The binary attributes of Forest dataset are excluded because of this high correlation that defines different properties compared to the numerical values in the context of fingerprinting. 
In \Cref{table:forest-attr}, the information about the attributes is given.

\paragraph{German Credit Data}
The dataset describes persons by attributes containing some personal information and classifies them as good or bad in terms of risk for the credit defaulting. 
The dataset has 1000 rows, 20 attributes and one target attribute.
13 out of 20 attributes in this dataset, as well as the target attribute in this dataset,  are categorical and we use this dataset to analyse the performance of the fingerprinting scheme for categorical data described in \Cref{subsec:fingerprinting-scheme-categorical} and for experiments on the impact of fingerprinting to a learning task in \Cref{sec:Learning}. 
The dataset is also chosen for its size. 
Because it is considerably smaller than Forest Cover Type, there is a possibility that the size of a dataset can affect the performance of fingerprinting algorithms.
Detailed information about the attributes in the dataset is given in \Cref{tab:german-credit}.

\end{table}

\paragraph{Adult dataset}
The dataset contains information about people such as their age, workclass, education, etc. and a target attribute whether a person makes at least \$50K per year or less than \$50K.
This dataset contains 15 attributes in 30,162 samples of training data (after removing samples containing missing values), where the attributes are both numerical and categorical (five continuous numerical and ten categorical). 
The same as German Credit dataset, we use this dataset to analyse the performance of fingerprinting scheme for categorical data in \Cref{subsec:fingerprinting-scheme-categorical} and for experiments on the impact of fingerprinting to a learning task in \Cref{sec:Learning}. \Cref{tab:adult_attributes} describes the attributes of the Adult dataset.

\subsection{Attacks}
In the following sections we discuss and analyse the robustness of the fingerprinting schemes, described in \Cref{sec:Fingerprinting}, against the following attacks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Subset attack - the attacker releases only a subset of the dataset rows as an attempt to erase the fingerprint
    \item Superset attack - the attacker adds additional rows to the original dataset and mixes them with the original rows
    \item Bit-flipping attack - the attacker flips arbitrary bits in the dataset in an attempt to erase the fingerprint
    \item Additive attack - the attacker inserts additional fingerprint to the data, claiming the ownership
    \item Collusion attack - multiple buyers compare their dataset copies and create a new copy in an attempt to erase the fingerprint of every buyer in the collision
\end{itemize}

\section{Summary}
In this chapter, we analysed the robustness of the fingerprinting techniques under certain types of attacks. We address subset attack, superset attack, bit-flipping attack, additive attack and collusion attack. 
As opposed to analysing the inability of a scheme to detect the fingerprint under a malicious attack, we also address the possibility of detecting the fingerprint in unmarked data - misdiagnosis false hit.

%misdiagnosis
\begin{figure}[ht]{
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/misdiagnosis.PNG}
    \caption{Misdiagnosis false hit rate}
    \label{fig:misdiagnosis}
 }   
 \end{figure}

To avoid the misdiagnosis false hit, the fingerprint length must be big enough. \Cref{fig:misdiagnosis} shows the robustness of a scheme given the assumed number of buyers. We see that for the larger number of buyers we must ensure the longer fingerprint, e.g. if there are 100 buyers, the fingerprint length $L$ should be larger than 30.
 
The additive attack is, like misdiagnosis false hit, not specific for a certain scheme. The robustness of the scheme against the additive attack depends on the number of marks the scheme embeds in the data, which is controlled by parameters $\gamma$ in AK Scheme and the Scheme for fingerprinting categorical data, by $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ in Two-level Scheme and by $\beta$ in the Block Scheme.
%additive
\begin{figure}{
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/additive.PNG}
    \caption{Robustness against the additive attack}
    \label{fig:additive-attack}
}\end{figure}
%subset
We show in \Cref{fig:additive-attack} the relation between number of marks and robustness of the scheme for different attacker's embedding patterns. 
The attacker's parameter of the ratio of the marked tuples is $\gamma'$ ($\gamma'=1,000$ means that one in a thousand tuples is marked). 
It depends on the attacker how he chooses to embed his fake fingerprint. If the dataset is very big and marking one in 10,000 tuples is sufficient to claim his ownership, then the fingerprinting schemes are not very robust - there is only 40\% chance that the attacker will not succeed. However, smaller datasets (10,000 tuples or less) might be harder to attack since the attacker would need to choose smaller $\gamma'$ to be able to claim the ownership. Schemes are much more robust if the attacker chooses $\gamma'<1,000$.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{minipage}{0.49\textwidth}{
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/subset-screensh.PNG}
        \caption{Comparison of robustness against the subset attack}
        \label{fig:subset-attack}
    }\end{minipage}\hfill
    %bit-flipping
    \begin{minipage}{0.49\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/bit-flipping.PNG}
        \caption{Comparison of robustness against the bit-flipping attack}
        \label{fig:bit-flipping-attack}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
Furthermore, we discussed the robustness against the attacks where the attacker modifies the dataset, e.g. subset attack and bit-flipping attack. A general conclusion is that more marks in the data mean better robustness. A somewhat smaller role plays the parameter $\xi$ that defines how many LSBs are available for fingerprinting such that is $\xi$ is bigger, the scheme is more robust. 
We compare the robustness of the discussed fingerprinting techniques against the subset attack in \Cref{fig:subset-attack} and the bit-flipping attack \Cref{fig:bit-flipping-attack}.
Robustness against the subset attack is measured as the largest percentage of tuples deleted where the scheme still detects the correct fingerprint with 100\% probability.
The AK Scheme shows the best robustness even for a smaller number of marks in the data. The Two-level Scheme and the scheme for categorical data are reaching a high robustness level for a larger number of marks in the data. The Block Scheme under-performs all the schemes.

Robustness of the bit-flipping attack is measured as the largest percentage of the LSBs that can be flipped while the scheme would still detect the correct fingerprint with probability 100\%.
AK Scheme again outperforms other schemes, except for the smaller number of marks where the Two-level Scheme is more robust. The Block Scheme is the least robust scheme against the bit-flipping attack. However, we can argue that all of the schemes are robust against the attack since they can all reach the level of robustness of $>0.4$.

We conclude that a good robustness level can be reached with a sufficient number of marks in the data. However, more marks in the data introduce more errors and they might significantly affect the utility of the data. In the next chapter, we will analyse how the utility is affected and if introducing the necessary number of marks to ensure the robustness is acceptable from the utility point of view.
