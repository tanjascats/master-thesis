I thank my parents for giving me unconditional and unlimited support, love and understanding through the years of my education. I thank them for teaching me the importance of hard work and constant learning. Without them and their set of values, which they have been so tirelessly passing on to me, this thesis would not be possible.

I thank my brother, my grandparents and the rest of my family for their patience, support and valuable advice. 

I express my sincere gratitude to my advisor, Rudolf Mayer, for his time, guidance, cooperation and patience during the process of writing this thesis. His encouragement helped me, not only during the period of writing the thesis but in academic progress in general, as well. Many thanks to my supervisor, prof. Andreas Rauber, for his help and support.

I would like to acknowledge all of my friends that shared with me the journey from the very beginnings of my master studies until this moment. I am grateful for keeping strong connections with my friends from the homeland, Croatia and for the new friends that I made during my studies in Vienna.
